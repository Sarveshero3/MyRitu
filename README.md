*   **Core Libraries:** Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit-Calendar, Streamlit-Option-Menu, Requests, Bcrypt, python-dotenv.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyRitu_harmony.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd MyRitu_harmony
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Hugging Face API Token:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root (`MyRitu_harmony/.env`).
    *   Add your Hugging Face API token:
        ```env
        HF_API_TOKEN="your_actual_hugging_face_api_token_here"
        ```
    *   Obtain a token from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (a "read" token is usually sufficient).
    *   **Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to your repository.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
    The app will open in your default web browser.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

1.  Ensure your code is pushed to a **public GitHub repository**. Your `.gitignore` file must prevent `.env` and `MyRitu.db` from being uploaded.
2.  Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with GitHub.
3.  Deploy a new app, selecting your repository, branch (e.g., `main`), and `main.py` as the main file.
4.  **Set Secrets:** In your deployed app's settings on Streamlit Community Cloud, add your `HF_API_TOKEN` as a secret. The key should be `HF_API_TOKEN` and the value your actual token.
5.  **Database Note:** For persistent data on Streamlit Community Cloud, the default SQLite setup will be ephemeral. For long-term data storage in a deployed app, consider integrating a cloud-based database solution.

## üîí Privacy & Data

*   **Authentication:** User accounts are protected by hashed passwords.
*   **Local Storage:** All user data is stored in an SQLite database (`MyRitu.db`) **locally on the device where the app is run** (during local development).
*   **Data Deletion:** Users have the option to permanently delete their account and all associated data from the local database via the Settings page.
*   **AI Chat:** A summary of your anonymized profile and recent Ritu data is sent to the Hugging Face API to provide context to the language model. Chat messages are logged locally.
