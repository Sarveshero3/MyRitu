## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend & Backend:** Streamlit
*   **Database:** SQLite (for local storage)
*   **AI Language Model:** Hugging Face Inference API (e.g., `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`)
*   **Core Libraries:** Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit-Calendar, Streamlit-Option-Menu, Requests, Bcrypt, python-dotenv.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyRitu_harmony.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd MyRitu_harmony
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Hugging Face API Token:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root (`MyRitu_harmony/.env`).
    *   Add your Hugging Face API token:
        ```env
        HF_API_TOKEN="your_actual_hugging_face_api_token_here"
        ```
    *   Obtain a token from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (a "read" token is usually sufficient).
    *   **Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to your repository.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
    The app will open in your default web browser.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

1.  Ensure your code is pushed to a **public GitHub repository**. Your `.gitignore` file must prevent `.env` and `MyRitu.db` from being uploaded.
2.  Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with GitHub.
3.  Deploy a new app, selecting your repository, branch (e.g., `main`), and `main.py` as the main file.
4.  **Set Secrets:** In your deployed app's settings on Streamlit Community Cloud, add your `HF_API_TOKEN` as a secret. The key should be `HF_API_TOKEN` and the value your actual token.
5.  **Database Note:** For persistent data on Streamlit Community Cloud, the default SQLite setup will be ephemeral (data resets on app restarts). For long-term data storage in a deployed app, consider integrating a cloud-based database solution (e.g., Supabase, Neon).

## üîí Privacy & Data

*   **Authentication:** User accounts are protected by hashed passwords.
*   **Local Storage:** All user data, including profile information, Ritu logs, and chat history, is stored in an SQLite database (`MyRitu.db`) **locally on the device where the app is run** (during local development).
*   **Data Deletion:** Users have the option to permanently delete their account and all associated data from the local database via the Settings page.
*   **AI Chat:** When using the MyRitu Chat, a summary of your anonymized profile and recent Ritu data is sent to the Hugging Face API to provide context to the language model. No chat history is sent, only the current query and the generated context. Chat messages are logged locally.
